# GPXEnricher
A very simple tool to enrich Garmin GPS Files (GPX)

# How use it ?
- Just dowload the project, unzip it, and open it in a browser (connected to internet to load Foundation components).
- Drag and drop your GPX file
- Press enrich to enrich it !
- You get your enriched file just beside the original one

# What can I do with that ?
- For now, the **speed** is the only data computed on top of that, but don't hesitate to let some comments or to fork to add some other components ;)
